- HARDWARE: 
     1. 2x Stepper Motors taken from old DVD drives: for moving the pen left and right, and the paper forward and backwards
     2. 2x Servo Motors: for pulling the pen up and down with the help of some strings
     3. 2x L293D ICs Motor drivers: for an easier control of the dvd's stepper motors
     4. 2x BreadBoards (3x optionally)
     5. 2x Supply Modules HW-131: for powering the stepper motors, as the usb connected Arduino Uno does not give enough for that task
     6. 2x Power Adapters
     7. 1x 1k ohms Rezsitor
     8. 1x 330 ohms Rezistor
     9. 1x Blue LED: brings attention to the user that the color needs to be changed
     10. 1x Active Piezzo Buzzer: same task as the Blue LED
     11. 1x Arduino Uno: controls all the mechanisms

 - HOW TO USE:
     - In order for the machine to work you would need an image and a gCode file that will tell the machine how to move in order to plot that image.
     For the image you need to use Inkscape. It's a free and open-source software that you can find [here](https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-0.92.4/) (version 0.48.5 is recommended).
