- HARDWARE: 
     1. 2x Stepper Motors taken from old DVD drives: for moving the pen left and right, and the paper forward and backwards
     2. 2x Servo Motors: for pulling the pen up and down with the help of some strings
     3. 2x L293D ICs Motor drivers: for an easier control of the dvd's stepper motors
     4. 2x BreadBoards (3x optionally)
     5. 2x Supply Modules HW-131: for powering the stepper motors, as the usb connected Arduino Uno does not give enough for that task
     6. 2x Power Adapters
     7. 1x 1k ohms Rezsitor
     8. 1x 330 ohms Rezistor
     9. 1x Blue LED: brings attention to the user that the color needs to be changed
     10. 1x Active Piezzo Buzzer: same task as the Blue LED\
     11. 1x Arduino Uno: controls all the mechanisms
